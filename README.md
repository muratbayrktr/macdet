## Models
### Finetuned models
The finetuned models from different families for different languages are available at the [drive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11dOv7iC7iEn3Bxj14bAt8iLxa4XV-KnZ?usp=sharing), you should download the ones you prefer and place them under the `/models/` folder. Note that `models` and `backend` are at the same level. You mÄ±ght also want to change the `model_dirs` inside the code.
